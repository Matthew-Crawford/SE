243 Puzzle Solver, Project Part 3:  Water, Clock, Chess, Jam

Your Name: Matthew Crawford
Your chosen new puzzle (Chess or Jam): Chess

Teammate Name:Group T


A. DESIGN
---------

1. Explain, in detail, the design of your new puzzle, and how it "connects"
to your common solver.

I have a ChessPiece class that is an abstract class that all individual pieces extend, I have 
a ChessBoard which represents the configuration of a board, and I have a chess class that 
extends my abstract Puzzle class and executes the program by creating a solver object and takes in 
a chess object, giving it access to all of the necessary functions.






2. What changes did you need to make to your existing design for part 2?
Originally we had a solver that did not use memoization at all, and because there were so many
possible configurations, redesigning it with memoization was an important step. We created a hashmap
that mapped a neighbor to the current, and the neighbor could only be added to the queue if it
was not already in the map. I did not notice, however, that added the hashmap was not enough
to complete the memoization. I needed to override hashcode and equals for my jug class because
the default hash compared their address in memory, so no two configs would be alike, and so my
hashmap ran out of heapspace when running big tests. I implmented the new hashcode function in jug.java
and ChessBoard.java, as they were my two configs for the two parts.








3. Did you and your partner work together on any part of this assignment?
If so, what exactly?   Please note, this was completely acceptable.
We did not work together at all, as stated above there was a problem with the bfs solver, and I fixed
it and gave it to him, but that's about all the interaction we have had with each other since
part 2.





B. TEAM INTERACTION
-------------------

4. I felt that __A______ puzzle was harder then the other.

    A. my
    B. my teammate's
    C. neither
    
On a scale of:

    1: Strong disagree
    2: Disagree
    3. Neutral
    4. Agree
    5. Strong Agree

answer the following questions:

5. I contributed to my teammate's puzzle: __5___
    
6. My teammate contributed to my puzzle: ___3__

7. If given the chance again, I would want to work with my teammate: _2____

8. Please provide any additional feedback regarding your teammate.
We went to the cs tutoring center on multiple occasions and he always showed up. However, he is dropping
SE so I am not sure if he cared about the project as much as I did. I did all of the typing and
asked most of the questions. He did find a major bug with the solver at the end, and worked on it
getting the print working on the last day, so I can't complain that much. I think if this was 
still his major he would have tried harder.




9. What was the best part about being able to work on this project as a team?
My partner had some good ideas to help finish up code, he caught the error in the buildpath in the solver
where I had .equals instead of !=, and he fixed the printout alone, so the best part of working in a team
was having someone to bounce ideas off of and periodically catch my mistakes.



10. Conversely, what was the worst part about being required to work in a team?
The worst part of working in a team would be I got the feeling he didn't all that much care about 
how we did and 





C. INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTION
--------------------------

Using the same 1-5 scale, answer the following questions.

11. I contributed to my puzzle: _5____

12. I feel this is a good project to learn about OOP: _3____

13. I personally learned a lot about OOP by doing this project: __3___

14. I think this project was too difficult: __5___

15. The lectures and labs provided adequate background for this project: __3___

16. Please provide any additional feedback you have regarding this project.
I think this lab should have been split up into two parts, I felt very overwhelmed even though I started
well before the due date.
